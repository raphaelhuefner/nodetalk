# Try to get node.js running with a concurrency of at least 1000 connections

Hi, my name is Raphael Huefner and I am a [Drupal](http://drupal.org) Developer by trade. I "recently heard" of "a new thing" called [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) which is being appraised as a web server capable of serving so many more clients at the same time (concurrently) with just a single process than good old trusty [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) could do with a bunch of pre-forked child processes.

I wanted to bring across some of the points made by node.js by giving a talk in front of my colleagues. 

This GitHub repository contains some notes and source code supporting this talk: 

* [notes on setting up a high concurrency environment on Mac OSX](doc/setup-macosx.md) on which I wasn't *that* successful
* [notes on setting up a high concurrency environment on Ubuntu](doc/setup-ubuntu.md) which are still kinda un-structured
